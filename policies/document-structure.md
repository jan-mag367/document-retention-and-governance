# Document structure (draft)

## Recommended top folders (SharePoint/Teams)
- 01 Governance (agendas, minutes, policies)
- 02 Campaigns (plans, assets, timelines)
- 03 Communications (templates, drafts, final)
- 04 Training (guides, onboarding)
- 05 Admin (forms, checklists, reference)

## Principles
- Keep one source of truth (SharePoint as primary storage)
- Use links rather than duplicate files
- Keep drafts separate from final documents
- Use version history instead of saving multiple copies
